I am experienced in making small-scale literal translations in many languages. These ten Basho (Hashiyou) haiku translations are my first in Japanese, with a few original romaji (romashi) divisions:


1) Old Pond

huru ike ya
kawasu tohikomu
misu no oto

Jilted - go or
Dodge; jump in,
Mistake of sound


2) Summer Grasses

natsukusa ya
tsuwamono tomo a
yume no ato

Familiarity, or
Enemy: friend, a
Dream of after


3) Autumn Evening

kare eta ni
karasu no tomari keri
aki no kure

Him as poor;
Crow of alight. Kicking
Free space of giving.


4) Journey/Death Poem

tahi ni yante
yume wa kareno wo
kakeme uru

Travel as romantic -
Dream to return his
Brokenness to sell


5) Cicada's Voice

shisukesa ya
iwa ni shimiiru
semi no koe

Stillness, or
Sink down as a boulder,
A locust of voice


6) Winter Rain

nosarashi wo
kokora ni kikamu
shi ure kana

Weather-beaten, to
Mind as; to feel like
In ripeness. Alas.


7) Morning Glory

asa ao ni
ware wa meshi kuu
otoku kana

Morning ao, as
Broken piece return - meal eat;
Man. Alas.


8) Cherry Blossoms

ki ni hurete
hiki mo itowanu
sakura kana

Tree as: touch;
Pull back. Also: willingly;
Decoy. Alas.


9) Spring Passing

yuku haru ya
tori naki uwo no
me ha namita

To move towards; to stretch - or:
Bird-less, burn incense. Of
Me, is tears.


10) First Winter Rain

hatsu shi ure
saru mo komino o
hoshi e nari

First time in ripeness:
Monkey. Also: garbage collection day. Oh!
Star, huh? Style.
